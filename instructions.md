🎨 Antigravity AI Website Generation Prompt: Viuna - Come to Veggie

Project Goal: Create a modern, visually appealing, and appetite-inducing website for a Turkish Çiğ Köfte restaurant under new ownership, named Viuna - Come to Veggie. The design must be extremely enticing and high-quality.

1. 🍽️ Concept & Theme

    Restaurant Name: Viuna - Come to Veggie

    Cuisine: Authentic Turkish Çiğ Köfte (spicy, meatless raw meatballs/wraps). The food is 100% vegetarian/vegan.

    Target Feeling: The UI must immediately make potential customers feel hungry, enticed, and curious. The design should convey freshness, vibrancy, health, and authentic taste.

2. 🌈 Color Palette & Style

    Primary Colors: Fresh Green (representing freshness, herbs, and vegan/veggie focus), White (cleanliness, modern feel), and Orange/Terracotta/Earthy Red (representing spice, warmth, the color of the Çiğ Köfte, and Turkish aesthetics).

    Style: Modern, Clean, High-Quality Photography/Imagery, and a touch of warm, inviting texture (perhaps subtle textures or patterns inspired by spices or Turkish ceramics).

3. 🖼️ Imagery & Visuals

    High-Impact Hero Image/Video: The first thing users see should be an incredibly appetizing close-up image or short, dynamic video of a perfectly assembled Çiğ Köfte wrap/plate, emphasizing fresh ingredients like lettuce, mint, lemon, and the rich color of the köfte. Crucial: Focus on the vibrant colors and textures of the food.

    Image Aesthetic: Bright lighting, sharp focus, professional-grade food photography.

4. 📐 Structure & Navigation (Header/Footer)

    Header: Clean, sticky header with the Viuna - Come to Veggie logo/name.

        Navigation Links: Home, Speisekarte (Menu), Galerie (Gallery), Über Uns (About Us/Story of Viuna), Kontakt (Contact).

        Call-to-Action (CTA): A prominent button for "Jetzt Bestellen" (Order Now) - Assume this links to a third-party service like Lieferando/UberEats.

    Footer: Standard footer including:

        Quick links.

        Social Media Icons (Instagram, Facebook).

        Address/Basic Contact Info.

        Impressum (Legal/Imprint).

5. 💻 Key Sections to Design

    Hero/Welcome Section: High-impact food visual, short tag line (e.g., "The Taste of Anatolia, Made Vegan"), and the primary CTA.

    Why Viuna? Section: Short, punchy section highlighting unique selling points (e.g., "100% Vegan," "Freshly Made Daily," "Authentic Spice"). Use bullet points and icons.

    Featured Menu Items: A visually-driven section showcasing 3-4 best-selling items (Çiğ Köfte Dürüm, Çiğ Köfte Teller, etc.) with brief, mouth-watering descriptions.

    Google Maps Location: An embedded, interactive Google Maps element showing the store's location.

    Testimonials/Reviews: A carousel or short list of compelling customer quotes.

6. 🌐 Language Options

    Primary Language: German (Deutsch). All content must default to German.

    Multilingual Toggle: A prominent, easily accessible language selector (e.g., using flags or language abbreviations DE/TR/EN) must be included in the Header.

    Required Languages: The main customer-facing pages (Home, Speisekarte, Über Uns, Kontakt) must support translation into:

        Deutsch (DE)

        Türkçe (TR)

        English (EN)

7. ⚙️ Admin Interface (Backend Design)

    Design Focus: Simple, intuitive, and secure (professional, but not overly stylized). Use the primary color palette for branding, but keep the interface clean and functional.

    Key Modifiable Sections for the Owner:

        Speisekarte Editor: Ability to add, edit, or delete menu items, prices, and descriptions.

        Image Gallery Management: Ability to upload, remove, and reorder photos on the website.

        Contact/Social Media Editor: Fields to update phone number, address, opening hours, and social media links (Instagram URL, etc.).

        Basic Text/Page Editor: Ability to change the "About Us" story or front-page slogans.

8. 🔗 Provided Context

Output Request: A high-fidelity, complete website mock-up design (including desktop and mobile views) that captures the specified color palette and enticing food focus, along with a separate, clear wireframe for the administrative panel.










LINE 100: 
few things need to change before internet publishing

Full Responsiveness: The design must adapt flawlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices (mobile-first approach).

Sticky Header: The header/navigation bar should remain fixed at the top of the screen during scrolling.

Smooth Navigation: Internal navigation links (e.g., jumping from Header to "Speisekarte") must use smooth scrolling.

Dynamic Imagery: Implement image carousels (for gallery/reviews) and subtle hover effects on menu items and buttons to improve interactivity and appetite appeal. (take random images of food from the internet)

Menu Interaction: The Speisekarte should be easy to browse with clear categories and visual separation. 

admin page: currently changes aren't able to be made. im changing the address and saving it but no changes are shown on the website. ensure changes are saved for all elements. 

change all 2024 to 2025
insta and facebook icons aren't showing up or they're wrong. fix them.
